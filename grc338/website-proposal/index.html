                <p>[image of 2 women holding ice cream cones and smiling]</p>

                <p>As do many great businesses, Dorothea's started out as a hobby. When we retired to the small beach town of Cayucos, California, we loved having our grandchildren visit during the summers.<br>
                One summer, we decided to make some ice cream from scratch as a fun science experiment for the kids. Five summers later, our grandkids had started bringing friends, and finding friends on the beach, and inviting a bunch of folks back to the house for ice cream every afternoon.<br>
                When we had kids lining up at our door every day from May to August, we knew we had to make this ice cream more accessible for these kids. This led to us opening the doors of Dorothea's the next spring, and we have been serving refreshingly nostalgic ice cream to folks of all ages ever since then!</p>
