While learning the ins and outs of all things espresso, I was enamored by the beautiful intersection of chemistry, artistry, and deliciousness that was involved in the entire process. I quickly learned everything I could, and my job became both my hobby and my favorite place. After graduating college, I spent a few obligatory years actually using my degree before realizing that my dream was to open up my very oen coffee shop and share the art of espresso with so many more people. We officially opened our doors in March of 2022. </p><h3>Meet the Owners</h3><div class="about-grid">
